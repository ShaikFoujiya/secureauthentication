# Role-Based Authentication System Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a role-based authentication system for the Secure Authentication project. The system now supports two distinct user roles: **Admin** and **User**, each with different dashboard experiences and access permissions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Changes
- ✅ Added `role` column to the `users` table
- ✅ Created default admin user with credentials:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Email: `admin@secureauth.com`
  - Password: `admin123`
  - Role: `admin`

### 2. Role-Based Authentication
- ✅ Modified login system to detect and store user roles
- ✅ Admin users skip face verification and go directly to dashboard
- ✅ Regular users still go through face verification process
- ✅ Session management includes role information

### 3. Dashboard System

#### Admin Dashboard (`/admin/users`)
- ✅ Full database access showing all users
- ✅ User management capabilities (view, delete users)
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin-only)
- ✅ Search functionality across username, email, and role
- ✅ Statistics display (total users, active users, etc.)
- ✅ Admin cannot delete other admin users

#### User Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- ✅ Personal profile display
- ✅ User-specific information only
- ✅ Security features overview
- ✅ No access to other users' data
- ✅ Clean, user-friendly interface

### 4. API Endpoints

#### Admin-Only Endpoints
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/user/<id>` - Delete user (admin only)
- `GET /admin/users` - Admin dashboard page

#### User Endpoints
- `GET /api/user-profile` - Get current user's profile
- `GET /dashboard` - User dashboard (role-based routing)

### 5. Security Features
- ✅ Role-based access control on all admin endpoints
- ✅ Session validation for role checking
- ✅ Admin users cannot be deleted by other admins
- ✅ Face verification still required for regular users
- ✅ Secure password hashing maintained

## How It Works

### Login Flow
1. **Email/Password Login**: System checks credentials and retrieves user role
2. **Admin Users**: Redirected directly to admin dashboard (`/admin/users`)
3. **Regular Users**: Redirected to face verification (`/loginface`)
4. **Face Verification**: After successful verification, users go to personal dashboard (`/dashboard`)

### Dashboard Access
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full system management, user database view, user management
- **User Dashboard**: Personal profile, security information, no access to other users

### Session Management
- Session stores: `username`, `email`, `role`
- Role-based routing ensures users only access appropriate dashboards
- Automatic redirects based on user role

## Usage Instructions

### For Admins
1. Login with admin credentials:
   - Email: `admin@secureauth.com`
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
2. Access full system management dashboard
3. View all users, manage accounts, monitor system

### For Regular Users
1. Login with email/password credentials
2. Complete face verification process
3. Access personal dashboard with profile information

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'user' AFTER password;
```

### Key Code Changes
- Modified authentication functions to handle roles
- Added role-based routing in dashboard endpoint
- Created separate dashboard templates
- Implemented admin-only API endpoints
- Added role validation middleware

### File Structure
```
templates/
├── admin_dashboard.html    # Admin management interface
├── user_dashboard.html     # User personal dashboard
├── dashboard.html          # Original (now admin_dashboard.html)
└── ... (other templates)
```

## Security Considerations
- Admin passwords should be changed in production
- Role-based access control prevents unauthorized access
- Session validation ensures proper user authentication
- Face verification maintained for regular users
- Database queries include role checks

## Future Enhancements
- User role management (admin can change user roles)
- Audit logging for admin actions
- User registration approval system
- Role-based permissions for specific features
- Bulk user management operations

## Testing
1. Test admin login: Use admin credentials to access admin dashboard
2. Test user login: Use regular user credentials and verify face recognition
3. Test access control: Try accessing admin endpoints as regular user
4. Test user management: Create/delete users from admin dashboard

The role-based system is now fully functional and provides a secure, scalable foundation for user management and authentication.
